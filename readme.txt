an app that creates a picture bucket for specific events... people can upload pictures they took for this event an everyone can see them

it's so that not one picture is missed from said event I also want to add the geolocation to these events to make sure that everything is
documented 


1.has to have users
2. events
3.one user has many events but one event has may users
4.must be able to upload the photo 
5.users's can add events and in those events can add photos
6. each event must have a location a name for the event and should be allowed to be private or not
7. in the event you should be able to upload a photo like a photo or save a photo in favorites
